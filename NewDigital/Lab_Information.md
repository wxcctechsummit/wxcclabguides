`Before starting the labs, please confirm that you can login to WxCC Admin portal and Agent desktop`

1. Control Hub/Administration portal should use a different user (Ex: user-1) with Administrator privileges. 

2. Agent desktop login should use a user (Ex: user-2) with  premium agent license ONLY. 
If agent is also assigned admin roles, this will cause issue with accepting digital contacts (limitation in controlled GA)

3. Identify Connect URL of your Gold Tenant. Request Connect owner in your org to add you as an admin user (Ex: user-3). Users are locally managed in Connect. (Review Lab 1(d) for steps)


`Lab Support`

1. All registered participants will be added to the support room. 

2. Tenant access should be discussed with respective partner org administrator. Please reach out to Cisco PSAM if any challenges identifying partner org admin. 

3. All other support queries and concerns can be raised in the support room.
