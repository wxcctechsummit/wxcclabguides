# Introduction

## Lab Objective

Describe the overall objective of the lab, including which features and/or components will be targeted. Explain with text and/or pictures as to what the feature/component does. The goal is to make is clear to the user what they are going to learn and how they will learn it and why it is important.

After the objective above, include a deployment diagram, which points out specifically where in the solution this lab targets. This can be a high level diagram or something as low as process specific. Take screenshots from the related power point session if the diagram already exists.

## Pre-requisite knowledge (optional)

Describe any pre-requisite knowledge to perform the lab

# Scenario 1: Major topic to be explored

## Introduction

Explanation of the scenario

## Exercise 1 – Name of the exercise

The goal here is to show the user the user interface of the feature/component, or walk them through the feature being worked on. In this section, write a very brief executive summary of what the user is about to do and why it&#39;s valuable. The goal is to make this relatively brief (the meat being in the next exercise topic), however if it gets too long, find a way to break it up. &quot;In this exercise we will look at how to integrate the SocialMiner Email and Chat gadgets into Finesse. This section provides an overview on how to perform this action after a 10.x upgrade to 10.6. The UCCX Administration Guide details more information for other scenarios. In any case, the gadgets do not appear when Finesse is initially activated, they must be manually added to the Finesse desktop layout.&quot;

### 1.1: Sub-exercise name

1. Itemize the steps for the lab as so. Start with bullet numbering at 1. If you are going to add a picture to the step,


1. Between main steps, use CTRL+ENTER to add a space, then hit ENTER again to start the next numbering.
  1. When adding sub steps, use ENTER + TAB to start the new sub step.
    1. Do this as many times as necessary.


2. Always add an extra space between the parent steps.

1. Resize any photos so they do not exceed the margins of the page!

### 1.2: Sub-exercise name

1. Another step of sub exercise 1.2
2. Another step


## Exercise 2: Name of the exercise

The goal here is to show the user the component communication flow between the various pieces in the feature. Use the tools provided in the product as much as possible. If possible, use one tool per exercise, showcasing various ways to collect information. This should be the meat of the lab, going through the technical details as much as possible. Create as many of these exercises as needed (keeping within the timeframe). Again, as always, in this section, write a very brief executive summary of what the user is about to do and why it&#39;s valuable.

### 2.1: Sub exercise name

1. Itemize the steps for the lab as so. Start with bullet numbering at 1. If you are going to add a picture to the step, use CTRL+ENTER to step down and add the picture. It makes the picture appear tight to the step, like they belong.


2. Between main steps, use CTRL+ENTER to add a space, then hit ENTER again to start the next numbering.
  1. When adding sub steps, use ENTER + TAB to start the new sub step.


# Scenario 2 – Another major topic

## Introduction

Explanation of the scenario

## Exercise 3 – Another exercise

Exercises keep counting from beginning to end, they do not restart on each exercise

The goal here is to create at least 1 (depending on time) break/fix scenarios for the user. Ideally, we want to break something (figure out how to do that for your exercise) and then have the user use the tools they just learned about (above) to investigate and figure out why. This section should not completely hand hold/walk the user through to the fix, but allow them to think about it with investigative research. At the end of the section, provide a brief explanation as to what broke, why, how it was or should be fixed, and the value of knowing such things. Again, as always, in this section, write a very brief executive summary of what the user is about to do and why it&#39;s valuable.

### 3.1: Sub-exercise name

1. Itemize the steps for the lab as so. Start with bullet numbering at 1. If you are going to add a picture to the step, use CTRL+ENTER to step down and add the picture. It makes the picture appear tight to the step, like they belong.

  1. Another sub step

#### What Happened?

At the end of the section, provide a brief explanation as to what broke, why, how it was or should be fixed, and the value of knowing such things. YOU MUST HAVE A WAY FOR THE USER TO FIX THE BREAK SO FUTURE LABS ARE NOT BORKEN AS WELL!

# Challenge lab 1: (Advanced exercise with no instructions) (optional)

## Introduction

The goal here is to create an open ended exercise with a pre-defined solution but no guidelines. This is designed for the top engineers attending the event that want a challenge. There will be rewards planned for the first 2 groups that find the solution to this lab.

Make sure it poses a serious challenge and maybe exposes some expert tips related to the product you are covering.

## Exercise 4

Add any instructions, be creative, don&#39;t give much information and make clear what needs to be achieved.

Let them know that they have to contact the Proctor as soon as they think they have the answer/solution.

## Challenge lab 1 Solution

### Instructions

This is the solution to the challenge lab, IT MUST NOT BE SHARED WITH ATTENDEES, IT IS JUST FOR THE PROCTOR
